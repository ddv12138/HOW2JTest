When I was just a little girl,I asked my mother,What will I be?Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?Here's what she said to me:Que sera, sera,Whatever will be, will be;The future's not ours to see.Que sera, sera,What will be, will be.When I grew up and fell in love.I asked my sweetheart,What lies ahead?Will we have rainbows day after day?Here's what my sweetheart said:Que sera, sera,Whatever will be, will be;The future's not ours to see.Que sera, sera,What will be, will be.Now I have children of my own.They ask their mother,What will I be?Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?I tell them tenderly:Que sera, sera,Whatever will be, will be;The future's not ours to see.Que sera, sera,What will be, will be.Que Sera, Sera!
